Putting accounts for roughly 40% of your golf score, making it the most important skill to master for lower scores.

## Setup and Stance

### Stance

- **Width**: Feet shoulder-width apart or slightly narrower
- **Weight**: Evenly distributed, slight favor to front foot
- **Posture**: Bend from hips, not waist, arms hanging naturally

### Grip

- **Pressure**: Light grip pressure (3-4 out of 10)
- **Position**: Hands work as one unit
- **Popular grips**: Conventional, cross-handed, claw

### Ball Position

- **Standard**: Just forward of center
- **Alignment**: Eyes directly over ball or slightly inside

## Stroke Mechanics

### Pendulum Motion

- Shoulders control the stroke
- Minimal wrist action
- Even tempo back and through

### Distance Control

- **Length of stroke** controls distance, not speed
- Practice ladder drill: 3ft, 6ft, 9ft, 12ft putts
- Develop feel for green speed

### Reading Greens

- **Slope**: Walk around the hole to see all breaks
- **Speed**: Faster greens break more
- **Grain**: Putts with the grain roll faster

## Practice Drills

### Gate Drill

Set up two tees just wider than your putter head, 2 inches in front of ball. Practice stroking through the gate.

### Circle Drill

Place balls in a circle around hole at 3 feet. Make all putts before moving to next distance.

### Lag Putting

Practice distance control from 20-40 feet. Goal is to get within 3 feet of hole.

## Mental Game

### Routine

- **Same routine every putt**: Read, practice stroke, align, stroke
- **Commit to the line**: Trust your read
- **Positive visualization**: See the ball going in

### Pressure Putting

- Make 5 three-footers in a row before leaving practice
- Practice with consequences (push-ups, extra putts)
- Simulate on-course pressure

## Common Mistakes

1. **Decelerating through impact**
2. **Moving head during stroke**
3. **Inconsistent tempo**
4. **Poor green reading**
5. **Lack of commitment to line**

Remember: Good putting is about consistency, not perfection. Focus on solid fundamentals and trust your stroke.
