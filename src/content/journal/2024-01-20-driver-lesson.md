Had my first lesson with the new instructor. Focused entirely on driver swing.

## Major takeaways

- My grip was too strong (2-3 knuckles showing)
- Backswing was too long and lost control
- Hip rotation needs to start the downswing

## Drills assigned

1. Grip practice with mirror
2. Half-swing drills for tempo
3. Hip-first downswing practice

## Immediate changes felt

- Ball flight was straighter with weaker grip
- More control with shorter backswing
- Still struggling with hip-first movement

## Practice plan

- 15 minutes grip work daily
- Half-swings before every range session
- Video myself to check positions

Lots of information to process. Need to focus on one change at a time rather than trying to fix everything at once.
