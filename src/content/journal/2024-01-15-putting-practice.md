Today I focused on putting for 2 hours. Started with some basic alignment drills.

## What I worked on

- 3-foot putts - made 7 out of 10
- Green reading on breaking putts
- Speed control on longer putts

## Key insights

- My stance was too narrow, causing inconsistent stroke
- Need to trust the read more instead of second-guessing
- Short putts require more confidence in the stroke

## What to work on next

- Practice with wider stance
- More green-reading exercises
- Build putting routine consistency

The session was frustrating at times, but I can see small improvements in my stroke mechanics.
